## Week 7: MVP Finally!

Apparently, last week I was having "decision paralysis", *no my brain was not actually paralyzed*. **"Decision paralysis"** formally known as **Analysis paralysis** is the state of over-analyzing or over-thinking a situation which causes a person to not be able to make a decision or perform an action. I was over-thinking about what sort of music to make/code. I realized I should not waste any more time and do some research about compatible instruments instead. Most of the articles/resources I found did not really apply to coding music since they were based on real instruments, but they were helpful. The articles gave me a sense of what sounds may be compatible with each other. 

#### Some of the articles and blog entries that I found useful are:  
- [Audio Effects: The Beginner’s Guide to Shaping Your Sound](https://blog.landr.com/audio-effects-plugins-guide/)

    -- I know this blog entry is not about compatible sounds/instruments, but it helped me understand sound effects better. Honestly, I did not understand sound effects and how to use them properly back when I learned about them through the EarSketch curriculum. However, this blog entry specifically explained when to use certain sound effects, how they work, and it described how the sound effects sound like. 

- [The Art of Combining Instruments and Sounds](https://music.tutsplus.com/articles/the-art-of-combining-instruments-and-sounds--audio-1500)

    -- This one is an article—*as its title suggests*—about combining instruments and sounds. Not only does the writer mention what sounds and instruments you may want to use for certain genres of music, he also gives possible steps you can take to "find your own sound". I did not follow his steps, but I tried to 'find my own sound' while using the sound files in EarSketch to code one of my music scripts. 
    
- [Image_Function_Directions.pdf](http://nebomusic.net/earsketchlessons/summer2013/Image_Function_Directions.pdf)

    -- This one is not an article or a blog entry, it is a PDF file that gives instructions on how to turn a picture from a link to an array (2D for black and white and 3D for color). I believe from the examples I saw it is not possible for me to use all the values from the array to sonify an image. 
    

I was going to include a link to the google doc on which my [**notes about EarSketch**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRKCfxsB8T20sBBnmmnsG8xiBFGDHdsU_ss4-TmUbe8/edit?usp=sharing) live on sooner or later. *My notes are not as organized and beautiful as other people's notes, so do not judge so harshly!*

#### I have another piece of news to tell you! Try to Guess!

I changed the image (from my previous entry) I was working on to...**THIS!**

You are probably wondering why I did that. Why would I abandon a picture of a beautiful and bright scenery for a picture of a dark forest!? **_I did that because I am allowed to do that and it is my choice! Be patient, I will answer your questions._** *(whispers)*. I do have moments of decision paralysis, but I am also a person who can let go of something I have been working on for a long time when I lose interest. I was working on the roadside picture from my previous entry, but as I was working on it I just felt it was not unique enough for me. These days many artists are releasing more upbeat songs which is great and all but I thought it would be boring if I made/coded an upbeat song. What really triggered my decision was the comeback of one of my favorite girl groups. I was working on my script that is influenced by the roadside picture, but I felt bored and needed to distract myself. I then went on YouTube and saw on my home that the new music video of the group I was waiting for released and decided to check it out. This group does horror music video concepts since they debuted which many artists in the KPOP industry avoid and their music is rock genre. After watching the music video, I felt like I should create a music script that has a more dark concept instead. So I began my search for an image of a dark and gloomy forest. 

**If you want to check out the script I made using the dark forest as an inspiration: [click here](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/#?sharing=cUqnriG7X8nRJ7dXU5Jw8A)!** *Do not expect too much, it sounds more like it is made for a game as a game's background music like for a mystery escape game.* 

Anyways, here are the directions after clicking on the link:

- Click on 'Run' 
- Then, click on the green play button on the top
- If you want to edit or play around with my code you can press the 'IMPORT TO EDIT' button, this will make a copy of my script for you to edit. 

### Takeaways
- **Abandoning older ideas for newer (better) ideas at some point is not something bad:** I have heard many people always telling me and other people around me that planning is good and following through your plan is good. However, I find myself defying that idea many times. Whenever I plan to do something for some reason in the process of working on that plan, I come up with an even better idea. Planning does not help me, it overwhelms instead. I dislike definite plans since I am a flexible person. I like plans that have room for modifications and flexibility. I am never filled with remorse for changing my plans because I feel remorse when I regret not changing something about my plan when I had the chance. There is nothing wrong with changing your plans and ideas.   

### Next Steps
- Sonifying an image takes a long time and I need to use the more complex functions to create an MVP of that script. It is more complicated then I thought. I know I have exactly 2 weeks to create the sonification script! Therefore, my next step is to create that script.
