## Week 5: *Figuring out what to do for my final project*

### My decision 
You are probably wondering, *"does it really take a whole week for someone to decide what to actually make/do?"*. Yes, it does for me! **Some people may consider this as my weakness, but I do not consider my indecisiveness as my weakness.** I cannot make decisions quickly, I ponder about the effects and consequences of possible decisions. Also, even if I do make a decision I change my mind quickly after thinking some more. Since last week, there has been a tug-of-war inside my brain between my possible ideas for the final project. **One of my initial ideas—while I was finishing up the EarSketch Curriculum—was to draw/create something in the DAW (Digital Audio Workspace) by coding music in the code editor in a certain pattern.** I thought about this potential idea and then searched on Google "drawing pictures with music". I clicked on the 7th link that appeared in the results, it was [an article about how MIDI drawings work](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8qbvap/how-do-these-midi-drawings-even-work). **_What is MIDI and how are MIDI drawings possible?_** MIDI is an acronym and it stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is a method of connecting devices that can make and control sound—like synthesizers, samplers, and computers—so they can communicate with each other. MIDI drawings in most cases are drawn using a keyboard—not a computer keyboard, a piano keyboard—according to the article I read. 

I saw examples of MIDI drawings, and realized: 

- A) I do not have a piano keyboard to create a MIDI drawing.
- B) I cannot use EarSketch to create a MIDI drawing or what I learned these past couples of weeks to create a MIDI drawing. 
- C) Even if I was able to somehow create a drawing on DAW without a piano keyboard and with what I learned, **this idea was not unique**! **Well, the product from this idea would not really be original or unique!** 

My other idea was to turn data into music or look at a picture to create a musical piece that would go along with the picture. I combined both of these ideas this week while thinking more about them. **For my final project, I decided to create two musical pieces using the same picture! One of the musical pieces will be based on the pixels of the picture I pick. The other musical piece will use that same picture as a muse (inspiration) to create a musical piece that suits the overall mood of the picture.** My idea is an example of sonification. We have learned since we were little how to turn data into visual data or to create a visual representation of data. **Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data.** *That is the formal definition.* I define sonification as using data that is normally not audible to turn it into audio or something that can be heard. I know many people have turned data into sound, but my idea is not completely not unique. What I am going to do is create these two musical pieces to compare them. Hopefully, when I present my project, I will not tell people which musical piece is data turned into music until I find out which musical piece they like. I will ask people to vote which musical piece and which musical piece they think matches the image in their opinion. Then, I will reveal which musical piece is made from data and which one is just inspired by the image.

### Takeaways
- **Spending time to consider possible decisions is necessary sometimes:** I did not decide right away what I wanted to do for my final project based on what I learned in EarSketch. I needed to consider whether my idea would create a unique product or not. I also needed to research whether my idea was realistically doable or not. I crossed out one of my ideas that were not doable and was not really unique. Then, I combined two of my other ideas to finally decide what I wanted to create.  


### Next Steps
- I will start to work on my two musical pieces for my final project.
- Before I do that, I need to find a picture/possible pictures I could choose to work with. My official next step is to search for an image that I can use as my muse and use its data.
