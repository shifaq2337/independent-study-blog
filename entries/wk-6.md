## Week 6: MVP, MVP, MVP, but not quite there yet!

### What is MVP?
What is an MVP? Is it a *Most Valuable Player*? *Most Villainous Person*? *Most Victorious Protagonist*?  None of the above. **MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product!**

### What have I been doing this whole week?
I am sure you are not interested at all and do not want to know. However, I have to tell you that **_this whole week was really a quest to create an MVP_**!  Overall, I struggled with deciding what sound clips to use for my scripts. First, I had to search for images that I can use as my muse/inspiration. I searched for scenery pictures using the [Creative Commons Search (website)](https://search.creativecommons.org). I will show the picture I chose in the end later. I thought after picking the picture that I might be able to complete the sonification based script by the end of this week. Guess what? I overestimated myself and realized I needed to do more research about sonification. So I decided I should instead work on the inspiration based script and create an MVP of just the muse script. Next week, I will start to create an MVP for the sonification script. 

### The picture I picked:

**The first thing I did after I picked the photo was write down my observations about the picture.** 

#### My Observations:

- **Sunset _reflection_** in the mountains. 
- **Roadside.**
- **Evergreen trees _around_ the road.** *Not exactly sure if the trees are all pine trees or not though?*
- **Snow _left_** in the mountains.
- **Grey mountains** with snow.
- **Blue sky** with **white clouds.** 
- Scenery that you **_would pass_** while on a road trip or on a long-distance driving trip. 
- Some **really green trees** are on the mountains and **_still growing_** on the mountains. 
- **Brown or maybe dry/dead vegetation _around_ the road.**

I am nowhere near done with the muse script. The truth is that I cannot figure out which instruments to use to create a musical piece that is inspired by the picture I chose. In other words, I have been thinking a lot about how to create a musical piece that fits with the picture, but I am stuck! It is so frustrating to go over each sound and decide whether I want to use that sound file or not. I also have to find compatible sound files too. I overestimated myself, it is impossible to create a song within 1 week. I need time to think and get inspired. Staring at the computer for a long time just makes me feel like I am not getting anywhere. I like to think without looking at the computer screen by instead looking at a blank piece of paper. Writing down my ideas and plans helps me sort my thoughts. 

### Takeaways
- **When you feel overwhelmed by whatever you are doing, take a break!:** When I feel overwhelmed or feel like I am not getting anywhere with my work, I do something else. A break for me is to stay away from whatever I am working on and instead maybe watch some funny videos or read something I like or watch some live performances of the musicians I like. Distracting myself helps my brain regenerate and then the lightbulb in my brain turns on. 
- **Take a step back if something does not go as you planned:** When I realized that I could not do an MVP of either the sonified music piece or the muse piece, I decided that I need to do more research. I need to take a step back and learn more to take a step forward. 

### Next Steps
1. Research and plan! I need to do more research about which instruments and sounds are compatible with each other. I also will need to pseudocode before I actually code the music. 
2. Not think about making an MVP of the sonified script until I complete an MVP of the inspirational piece. 
3. I may ask some people to describe what sort of feeling they feel while looking at the picture I chose. Understanding other people's perspective may help me.
