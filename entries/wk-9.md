## Week 9: Preparing to Present 

Presentations. We all have a wide range of reactions when we hear the word "presentations". Some people just seem very confident and are able to present smoothly. Some people tend to be nervous and may present a little less smoothly. There is no excuse such as 'that person just can present well' or 'that person has prior experience of presenting' because if you practice presenting and prepare your presentation concisely, you should be able to present more smoothly. 

#### Some Tips
- Plan what you will be saying
- Your slides should not include everything you will say! 
- Slides are there to help your audience see what you are talking about. Pictures are helpful depending on the information you are presenting. 
- Give general details about your project and about what you learned because your audience may not understand the specific details. Especially when you explain a code snippet, the audience will lose interest if you talk about a complicated and too specific code concept.
- Eye contact is important too, you should not just be facing the board. 
- Before you even start talking about anything else you should say something to hook your audience. 
- Before ending the presentation, say something thoughtful. 
- Don't be nervous: pretend like you are just projecting your thoughts to yourself.
